## Book Recommender System using Machine Learning
This project implements a book recommendation system using machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering. Recommendation systems are vital in providing personalized suggestions to users, enhancing user experience, and increasing engagement. Collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique, is employed to predict book ratings and generate recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains user ratings for books. It includes information about users, books, and their respective ratings. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and transformed into a user-item matrix for collaborative filtering.

## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a technique that makes automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users. In this project, the user-item matrix was constructed, where rows represent users, columns represent books, and the matrix values are user ratings. Cosine similarity was calculated to measure the similarity between users, and predictions were made based on this similarity metric.
